## TODO 
- add access login
- display timestamps on the X axis of the histogram
 - histogram: draw(day/hours) on  X axis 
- make program even more robust if file have invalid format. Error 500 if file > limit configured
- Add validation of data file: point number progressive (no holes?) , timestamps progressive (no holes?)
- JS file pre validation (size, extension, empty) before user press btn "upload"
- Upload file in a temp dir (which might be configured) & remove file and dir after they are no loner needed
- cron job to be sure to remove all temp files ?
- data time input in GUI: if seconds, minutes are missing assume == 00 min :00 sec 
- give more info why data in file are invalid (where)
- multiple files ?
- Add proper logging
- log in ? + store settings (eval param somewhere)
- Make more robust respect date/time input (no error 400)!!
- Btn Evaluate, Upload should be enabled only if text/file fields are not empty / correct
- Add possibility to see the data format to parse the timestamps with
- Add custom date / time widget?
- make timestamp format configurable (US / UK ( custom) / timezone?)
- improve usability: make file resettable -reset all fields 
- import/upload evaluation param?
- re-organize JSPs: put common parts of JSP like eval params form, file name in segnments, velocity / tiles fragments?
- remove useless attrib from session
- upload multiple files
- try to deploy on tomcat (on server)
- generate the table using same JSON dataset used by histogram 
- eventually if javascript not available generate table (histogram) JSP (svg) ?
- eventually remove the dataset from model, keep only JSON dataset
- Add login
- rewrite the json generation using some JSON Java API (json.simple?) - add junit tests
- re-style the rect tooltips -> event. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21703318/is-it-possible-to-enhance-the-default-appearance-of-svg-title-tooltip
 - in home.jsp: disable the "upload" submit btn if no file has yet be chosen
 - in home.jsp as soon a file is chosen content should be (roughly) checked and upload should be automatic(no need for upload btn)
 

## DONE ##
- GRAPH results using D3js
- histogram draw Y axis + min & max temperature values (as horizontal dashed lines )
- validate the eval. parameters (temperature min, max + dates)
